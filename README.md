# LibraryManagementSystem
A Library Management System using mySql as a database

Description:
Library is one of the most useful places for the students when they are
studying, doing research, etc., but due to the pandemic that we are experiencing right
now, we canâ€™t go to these libraries. So, this program will be a huge help for the
students. This includes, the date of borrowing a book, date of issuing the book and the
date of returning the book. The list of books that will be included are all free. Upon
late returns, remarks will also be listed in the system.
Features:
The main features of this system are:
- Admin Log in
- Issue Books
- Return Books
- Register Students
- Register Books
- Register Admin
